					<description><![CDATA[Oh, that&#039;s so cool, I&#039;m really chuffed to hear that! :)
I sense a hashtag coming on... how about something like: #PervertedClothedAndProudOfIt or #PervPrudesUnite - am sure there are much better ones out there!]]></description>

Yes! Your nudity-averse post is partly why I wrote this. I thought hang on, people have all these expectations and they&#039;ll never learn that practically nobody is really normal unless we tell them, right?

Though actually, maybe that was an afterthought. I mostly just felt like I was lying. Subs do have this tendency to confess. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Weird&#039; is in the eye of the beholder, I&#039;d say.  I spent huge chunks of my life trying to be &#039;normal&#039; and convincing no one in the process. And also finding out that all of us are a bunch of raging idiosyncrasies underneath. 
The outing bit made me laugh too. I outed myself as a nudity-averse prude to a few friends a few years back, and was stunned when some of them said &quot; me too&quot; . I&#039;d expected to have been laughed out of the room, as we&#039;re all supposed to be huge fans of nakedness nowadays! 
Three cheers for weirdness :D Long may it thrive!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/i-am-just-weird/#comment-684&quot;&gt;Vivian Nyx&lt;/a&gt;.

&quot;All AND nothing&quot; is indeed a better way to put it. Your way sounds more internally consistent. But I&#039;ve found that it is no good trying to deny my comfort levels. 

And I&#039;m delighted to hear that I&#039;m not alone with respect to Dawkins!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been told I&#039;m brutally honest a lot :p I&#039;ve learned to take it as a compliment.

I also subscribe to the &quot;all or nothing&quot; philosophy. Unfortunately, I tend to lean too heavily towards the &quot;all&quot; end of that spectrum. Although if I&#039;m reading your post right, you seem to be more of &quot;all and nothing&quot; - some things are no trouble to talk about, others are kept pretty close to the chest.

Also good to know that I am not the only one Richard Dawkins has converted from atheism/agnosticism to pretty-much-Buddhism.

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;What legs?&quot; 

Hmmm. Weird AND legless. 

Well, that&#039;s me on a Friday night, so ... glad it&#039;s you too. 

(Weird is good. Course, we&#039;d all say that, wouldnt we?  But that&#039;s because we&#039;re right.)]]></description>
