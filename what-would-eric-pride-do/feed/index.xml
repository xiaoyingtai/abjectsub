					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/what-would-eric-pride-do/#comment-337&quot;&gt;Amy Juicebox&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you! I wonder if the reason is that when I do hug, I make like a limpet? I actually have a tendency to stumble afterwards if not steadied by a helpful hand. It represents a lot of intimacy for me.]]></description>

Thank you! I&#039;ve been neglecting found literary BDSM lately, but it&#039;s supposed to be one of the themes of this blog. There are two posts in the pipeline, one about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bartleby.com/142/316.html&quot; title=&quot;Not My Enemies Ever Invade Me&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;love and this Walt Whitman poem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/pain-is-a-battering-bastard-and-more-part-1/&quot; title=&quot;Tortures&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;chronic pain and this Wisława Szymborska poem&lt;/a&gt;. I guess we are both into unexpected intersections. :)]]></description>
