Thank you! I have four of those adorable gingerbread men pics, so now of course I&#039;m obligated to write four posts on this topic, right? :p]]></description>

LOL! I aced it? That&#039;s a funny way to describe being reduced to a trembling mess in ten minutes flat, but it certainly feels great to know I was, er, enjoyed. :) And especially that my sexual hangups enhanced rather than impeded the entertainment!]]></description>

Oh dear, sorry to disappoint! I didn&#039;t leave out much, and certainly nothing important. Since writing this post I have realised that I experienced it much more as a humiliation scene than as an interrogation scene. But if you would like to fill in the blanks, please just imagine a lot more questions along the same lines. Like the exact nature of my boyfriend&#039;s erection.]]></description>

Thank you! It was very tempting to censor all the irrational parts. But I guess I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t. :)]]></description>
