					<description><![CDATA[It makes me very, very sad to realize that what you say is true of most American men..  It makes me feel even more alone in the world.  Of the men I know only about 10% would sincerely apologize for overstepping a lady&#039;s social boundaries.

But please do keep this in mind...there are still about 10% of us left! :)]]></description>

Thank you - you have put your finger directly on the bit I fussed about! Here is what I concluded from the fussing, but didn&#039;t include in the post:

(a) I don&#039;t think men have to feel *more* powerful than women to be gentlemen. Women on an equal footing apologise to each other all the time. I think the key is not feeling so threatened about whatever power you do have.

(b) On male-female power gaps - I have to agree that gender equality in vanilla life would be a good thing. It makes better allowances for individuality and provides a necessary check on abuse. But I think we can also agree that there is a gap between what should be and what is. Currently men are still sexually privileged, and as long as that privilege exists, I want it to be used for good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really interesting post, especially to me as an American woman. When I think about how we treat male-female power gaps, I do see a big difference in the behavior expected from a Dom versus from just any man.

To me, that difference is a good thing, because in day-to-day life, I DO want to feel equal in power to a man. (When you say &quot;I’ve also started to wonder if the problem is that these men don’t feel powerful,&quot; I agree but I don&#039;t think it is necessarily a problem.) ONLY within the special D/s agreement, both parties agree that one holds power over the other.

Anyway, I really enjoyed your take on this! Very thoughtful writing :)]]></description>
