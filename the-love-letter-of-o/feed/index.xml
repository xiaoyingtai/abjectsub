					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/the-love-letter-of-o/#comment-755&quot;&gt;shinykicks (@shinykicks)&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks! I found it really interesting where she does and doesn&#039;t report O&#039;s feelings and reactions. And one of the group members said he&#039;s going to reread it looking for the religious language this time. I&#039;m curious what you&#039;ll find!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this superb article.  I am going to have to dust off my Story of O this weekend (somewhere in the attic) and read it again.  

Anne Desclos was a fascinating woman.  She lived and wrote in very interesting times.

BTW Great blog - so happy to have found it.
