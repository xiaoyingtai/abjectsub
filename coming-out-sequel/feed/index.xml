					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/coming-out-sequel/#comment-40&quot;&gt;JT&lt;/a&gt;.

I am really slow. It took me this long to realise that my post &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/03/22/self-esteem-for-bottoms/&quot; title=&quot;Self-Esteem for Bottoms&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Self-Esteem for Bottoms&lt;/a&gt; took inspiration from your comment. For which thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lol &quot;muggles&quot;!  Never thought of it that way.

I think that when people read what you write in your blog they automatically reference the only &quot;BDSM-related&quot; information to which they have access...The Gimp, online images from sex-toy ads, and &quot;Dominatrix&quot; characters from bad TV shows...and immediately imagine bizarre people and practices that they can&#039;t even begin to understand.  I think if they had some way of understanding that &quot;power exchange&quot; doesn&#039;t mean &quot;dress me up like a French maid and beat me with a rolled-up copy of the Wall Street Journal while I cluck like a chicken&quot; then they might be able to relate better to your feelings about power and sexuality.

They probably never stop to think that there is a power dynamic to their sexual desires as well...how many &quot;normal&quot; people &quot;like to be on top&quot;, after all?  Or prefer their partner to be the one who initiates sex?  Their desires are no different than yours or mine, they just express them differently.  Or, I suspect, in many cases they don&#039;t express them at all.  ;)]]></description>
