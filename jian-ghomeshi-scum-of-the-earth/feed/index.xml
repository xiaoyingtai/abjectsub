I&#039;m in agreement with everything Jaime said, and also this remark. Definitely didn&#039;t &quot;do it wrong&quot;, it&#039;s just that there are layers and layers and layers!]]></description>

Oh good. Then I&#039;m glad I provided the opportunity! Nice of you to reassure me.

And long responses are an honour. I just don&#039;t feel like I have the experience to agree or disagree with your general observations. I do heartily endorse the first and last paragraphs though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When a dom and sub are new to each other, then things like &quot;stop&quot;, and &quot;please no&quot;, and so on, really are safe words. A submissive can always forget their &quot;agreed&quot; safe word in the heat of the moment.

So if the submissive isn&#039;t happy and needs to stop, then &quot;stop&quot;, or &quot;red&quot;, or &quot;no!&quot;, or anything on those lines, should work. If it was theatre and the sub&#039;s really ok, then the scene can continue. 

If a submissive wants the fun of screaming and begging me to stop, secure in the knowledge that I won&#039;t (unless she uses the real word), it&#039;s best let me know that beforehand. 

That usually works out well, when starting. Later, a dom can be less formally careful, because he or she knows more about the sub&#039;s limits and reactions. 

For punishment, when it&#039;s a long-term relationship, my rhetoric is that there&#039;s no safeword, and I decide when she&#039;s had enough. That&#039;s the rhetoric: the reality is that I watch her carefully to make sure she&#039;s okay and handling it. Tears count as part of &quot;okay&quot;. Panic, or shutting down is not okay. 

The shutting down thing is complicated. If it&#039;s quietly going floaty into subspace that&#039;s fine; if it&#039;s, &quot;the world is terrible and I am not in my body; I&#039;m not here at all&quot;, that&#039;s not fine. 

But it&#039;s about knowing the other person and having experience together. You start slow and learn how that person reacts. You can still give a strong experience without heading into safeword territory. 


Which is why I didn&#039;t believe Jian Ghomeshi&#039;s story. Even if it wasn&#039;t for the women who said that he started hitting and choking them without consent. 

But he&#039;s claiming he&#039;s doing bdsm with safewords and consent. And you don&#039;t start a bdsm relationship with face-smacking and choking, unless you&#039;ve done some serious discussion beforehand. Which it&#039;s clear he hadn&#039;t done.

Face-smacking and choking are big on the internet, and I think that&#039;s why he started there. Without discussion. I guess he imagined it&#039;d be a nice surprise.  

I don&#039;t think they&#039;re especially big with submissive women. Some like that, but they come up as a hard limit with a lot of submissives I&#039;ve met. &quot;No cutting or blood, no scat, no hitting my face, no choking.&quot;

Personally I don&#039;t do throat choking, not even if I&#039;m asked for it. I just think it&#039;s too damn dangerous. I might hold my palm over her mouth and pinch her nose, for a few seconds at a time, if I got hints that she wanted breath play. 

But seizing and squeezing the throat: I&#039;ve been a nurse (psychiatric, but still a nurse), and I Will Not Do That.

I will do face-slapping. It&#039;s a good way of shocking a submissive and &quot;dropping&quot; her, but a dom has to be confident that the sub knows him/her well, and feels bedrock secure that the dom likes her a lot, and has never been angry with her or disliked her. Because it feels much closer to domestic violence, for a lot of women, than to sexy kinkiness.

So it&#039;s not the first bdsm thing you do, unless the submissive specifically said, &quot;Nah, getting spanked or tied up or having to serve bores me: just punch my face and choke me, that&#039;s all I want.&quot; 
 
And I&#039;ve never met a submissive who&#039;s said that. I&#039;m pretty sure Jian Ghomeshi hasn&#039;t either. 

In fact, it doesn&#039;t seem that he&#039;s met any submissives, only women with whom he thought he could get away with stuff. Glad he was wrong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a quick note that for some people, &quot;Stop! No! Don&#039;t!&quot; is the same as your &quot;flinch and gasp&quot; - which is why safewords that aren&#039;t &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;no&quot; or &quot;don&#039;t&quot; are needed by some people. But this is all part of negotiation - it&#039;s on the top to make sure beforehand they know which is which for a partner.

(Also, it&#039;s often possible for non-verbal cues accompanying stop/no/don&#039;t to make the difference between &quot;I like being able to say this&quot; and &quot;I really mean it&quot;)

I think for any responsible top, &quot;Huh, that feels weird.” is a world apart from no/stop/don&#039;t, because most things aren&#039;t supposed to - it sends a warning signal that doesn&#039;t belong in a roleplay/scene. The exception is when someone is new to sensation-play and is experiencing things for the first time, in which case &quot;what&#039;s that feeling?&quot; might be expected. Personally, when bottoming I actually need to be able to say &quot;that feels weird&quot; without stopping things (although slowing down would be wise), because I&#039;m probably figuring out my emotional responses; for weird that needs a stop, I&#039;d probably choose &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;not quite right&quot;.

As for Ghomeshi, I entirely agree with your PS. As I&#039;ve seen it reported, there are classic techniques of abusers in his behaviour.]]></description>
