					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been reading a lot recently trying to understand my orientation, and this really helped clear things up! Looking at how I behaved in past vanilla relationships, I&#039;m a total service sub. A micromanaging scene would be terrible - I strive for perfection and being told over and over how I&#039;m doing everything wrong would be torture. Similarly I think an interrogation scene would just kill me. No pleasure out of that from me, I think I&#039;d literally drop to the ground and beg forgiveness LOL]]></description>

You won&#039;t believe how happy your comment makes me. I learn so much every time I visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.notjustbitchy.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;your blog&lt;/a&gt;, I never thought I would be able to reciprocate!

It&#039;s amazing how differently our kinks work. I love failure. I think that&#039;s what put me under so quickly when &lt;a href=&quot;/diabolical-genius/&quot; title=&quot;Diabolical Genius, or I Love Interrogation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I got interrogated&lt;/a&gt; - the questions were so embarrassing that I kept dropping my eyes and having to jerk them back where they were supposed to be. In retrospect I know it was practically an impossible order, but at the time all I could feel was mounting shame at my disobedience. And it was addictive.

I&#039;ll just have to hope and pray that the dom was amused. Because I do have that much in common with service subs - it ruins everything if the dom doesn&#039;t like it. And if the dom is turned on, but I&#039;m not, sometimes it still works for me emotionally, and I can&#039;t describe how wonderful that feels. 

I fully grant that emotional masochism is weird. And probably quite separate from control-oriented submission.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Holy crap, service vs control submission makes so much sense! Seriously, I&#039;ve spent years wondering what the hell people who wanted &quot;training&quot; were talking about. I&#039;m very much service oriented in my relationships but not interested in ritual, so I just never understood why someone would need extensive training to serve me a cup of tea, for example. But if what someone wants is a micromanagey scene where they repeat every step until they get it perfect and get &#039;punished&#039; for every (possibly imaginary) mis-step, that actually makes sense to me. 

Because I&#039;m so service oriented, I thought it was about the service being provided, not about being controlled. The whole training idea just makes so much more sense when I understand that the &#039;service&#039; is kind of the peg the scene hangs on, but not the point of the scene, if that makes sense. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;But I want what I want, dammit!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That reminds me of this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xojane.com/sex/im-sexually-submissive-but-please-dont-ask-me-to-finger-a-stranger-the-trials-and-tribulations-of-kinky-dating#comment-907234577&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;brilliant comment&lt;/a&gt; I read on a blog post about being submissive and dealing with douchebag doms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sooo often with the guys who do not understand that the dynamics of being a dom include actually getting your partner off as well.
I like being submissive because it turns me on, not because it turns you on..so do something with that!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;m dominant because it turns me on, not because it turns submissive men on, why shouldn&#039;t you be the same?]]></description>

What the hell? Akismet dared to think you were spam? Bad plugin, bad, bad!

Returning to your actual point, you are so right. Although maybe the underlying principle is that I shouldn&#039;t attach moral value to my submissiveness, any more than I should demonise sadists for what they want. Fetishes just are, I need to reserve moral judgments for behaviour.]]></description>

Got it, thanks. I&#039;m reading the comments on that first post, and I like the lady who says, &quot;avoid the common pitfall of thinking that something you enjoy doing is necessarily less submissive because you enjoy doing it.&quot; I think that can be applied to both Unspeakable Axe&#039;s concerns and your own concerns. Do you agree?]]></description>

Ack! You have made me realise that I can&#039;t define it myself. It literally seems to be doing for a dom the kind of thing they would normally have to pay for. Usually menial services, but not necessarily.

I think I first heard of service subs through Unspeakable Axe. Surprisingly, he had a rather similar moment of crisis: &lt;a href=&quot;http://unspeakableaxe.com/service-oriented-or-just-desperate/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Service-Oriented, Or Just Desperate?&lt;/a&gt; But his most memorable post on the subject is probably &lt;a href=&quot;http://unspeakableaxe.com/naked-service/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Naked Service&lt;/a&gt;.

And thanks for alerting me to undefined jargon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wasn&#039;t sure what service vs. control subbing meant... I think I have an idea now after reading a few things, but maybe you can help put it in clear terms.

If I understand correctly, then I am soooooooo NOT a service sub. Sounds absolutely boring and awful to me. And, no, I don&#039;t think that makes us selfish, not abnormally so at least. I just love being under the thumb of another person, made vulnerable, exposed, teased... And there are more than enough Doms who can jibe with that, so I think we&#039;re in luck :)]]></description>
