We&#039;ll see, she says glumly. Though you have cheered me up a little. I am always amused how much contempt dominant men have for dominant men who haven&#039;t got over their demons/incompetence yet!]]></description>

I think it will help!  Those who actually have an interest in talking with someone as a friend will take the time to come to your blog, read it, and exchange ideas.  Dickbrains will just click on to the next (and most likely fake) picture of a pretty girl because they&#039;re not really at CM to find a relationship or even just a sub, they&#039;re just trying to feel powerful by playing at &quot;domination&quot;...if they ever had the opportunity to actually meet a woman from CM they&#039;d probably respond by hiding under their beds!  ;)

So I think it&#039;s a great &quot;natural filter&quot;.  Great idea!  :)]]></description>

I had my doubts about approving a comment which is so much like a personal message, but decided that it&#039;s helpful for everyone to hear about CollarMe from the other side.

You guys have it tough. In my case I can tell you it would be better not to send a one-word follow-up message so quickly. And here is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20131128140749/http://www.collarme.com/StrongBlkRuler&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;profile that impressed me and lots of other women&lt;/a&gt; [edit: this is an archived version]. I don&#039;t know if other women check out full profiles; I did if the initial message was short and sweet and suggested it.

Edit: Argh, that previously impressive guy has just sent me an unaccompanied friend request. Another one bites the dust ...

I hope your blog brings you connections. There are relatively few male dom bloggers, and the response to my &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/02/16/the-society-for-the-prevention-of-cruelty-to-sadists/&quot; title=&quot;The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Sadists&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sadist post&lt;/a&gt; suggests that female submissives would like to read about the way you think.]]></description>

Initiated one, I know your preference for small breasts is relevant, but it&#039;s not good for whatever calm and respect for mankind I possess.

I think people with yellow fever should be embarrassed by it, just as with any prejudice. We can&#039;t help having types, but women generally do not like feeling interchangeable.

Regarding OkCupid, my doctor&#039;s orders *are* to moderate my computer use.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Yingtai!
I saw your CM profile, and sent, what I hope was, a respectable message. I also read your posts here around that time. Doing so lead me to starting my own blog, for the first time in my life.

I understand the problems with CM and sites like it. JT&#039;s advice there sounds like good ideas, and I may actually alter my profile after reading his comment.

Not knowing what to say in that initial message is a pretty intimidating feeling, at least that&#039;s how I feel. I search by location, then read profiles, and when I see someone who I like to actually meet, I&#039;m afraid of saying something that makes me sound like a one-night stander, but don&#039;t want to propose marriage after the first date, either. Then, not knowing the reaction I&#039;d get makes me second guess everything I type. I don&#039;t normally get responses, and I assume it&#039;s because of the volume of messages they receive, but I&#039;m never really sure. It&#039;s a problem for those of us that are there for the connections.

Just my thoughts. Keep the posts comming!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Yingtai, nice to meet you.  I have a few thoughts.  First, your blog works to bring the initiated to you as it worked for me and I am here and I sent you a contact message..

Second, you might want to try out OKCupid too as it seems that is the dating site where you can hint at your submissiveness, but need not put it all out there like at Collar Me and Fetlife--and thus the intereaction can also be much more refined (but admittedly not always) but you will still be innundated with potential suiters.

Third, as for yellow fever, what is your perception of it?  Admittedly, I like Asian women, but not exclusively, and not because I think they are naturally submissive.  I just like petite brunettes with smaller breasts and a lot of Asian women fit that bill.  Also, in my experience, Asian women born in Asia or who have parents who were born in Asia are generally more calm and respectful and more feminine in that they understand the male female dynamic and are not trying to be at odds with or hostile to men (or be like men) as a lot of Western feminist teachings has done to a lot of Western born women.  To me, these types of Asian women just are comfortable in their own skin and their gender and the biological inclinations that go along with it.

Finally, I am a little concerned about your joint pain.  You mention that you now forced to use speach recognition software.  I do not mean to pry, but I hope you are seeing a doctor as it could be some immune issue such as rheumetoid arthritis or a similar afliction.  Again, not to pry, just a bit concerned.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/collarme-and-my-off-switch/#comment-22&quot;&gt;JT&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you! Compliments *and* assistance - what a bonanza.

I need to clarify that the primary problem is not the wolves. It&#039;s the preschool teacher feeling. Also:

(1) I&#039;m convalescing from joint problems. Maintaining this blog is a challenge even with speech recognition software. Clicking through CM leaves me in pain - not the good kind!

(2) You&#039;ve made me realise that I&#039;m not looking for a partner yet. I&#039;m looking for friends who might become close friends, mentors and maybe a partner. So my profile now states that I&#039;m not receiving CM messages, but am happy to meet via my blog. Do you think it will work?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Yingtai.  JT here.  This really is a great blog, thanks very much for sharing it with us.  :)

I have a recommendation for you (if you haven&#039;t tried it already) about CollarMe and sites like it:  try posting a profile with no pictures at all.  This would automatically filter out most of the guys who immediately respond (with their dicks more than with their brains) to pictures of a pretty girl as well as keeping the &quot;yellow fever&quot; crowd at bay (especially if you don&#039;t list your ethnicity).  I bet this would reduce the number of responses that you&#039;d have to wade through by 90%.

Also, CM allows you to attach pics to your messages, and I&#039;m sure many other sites do as well.  So if you decide to contact someone then you can attach a pic to your initial message.

Maybe you&#039;ll feel less like you&#039;ve been &quot;thrown to the wolves&quot;, because you&#039;ll have fewer clowns demanding your attention and more control over deciding with whom to converse?

Give it a try and let us know if it works.  :)
