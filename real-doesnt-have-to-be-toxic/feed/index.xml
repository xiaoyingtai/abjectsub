It is very strange to me too. But she says she is at peace with it. I&#039;m starting to think the less I say the better. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/real-doesnt-have-to-be-toxic/#comment-173&quot;&gt;Xiao Yingtai&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, it does seem heartrending, doesn&#039;t it?  I can&#039;t imagine being unable to be at peace with my ability to experience pleasure, or always believing that there is a core of evil in my own happiness.  Unless I am totally misunderstanding what Remittance Girl is saying?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/real-doesnt-have-to-be-toxic/#comment-171&quot;&gt;JT&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you so much, JT. You put it much more concisely and clearly than I could. And I really need a friendly voice right now so it&#039;s very welcome. I wouldn&#039;t say Remittance Girl&#039;s point of view is myopic, but it is heartrending if that&#039;s what she really believes. And after our Twitter conversation I am pretty convinced.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very well said, Yingtai.  If someone&#039;s &quot;kink&quot; is to feel that they are behaving unethically when engaging in consensual BDSM then I hope that their feelings of transgression bring them pleasure, but it certainly doesn&#039;t mean that the rest of us aren&#039;t &quot;real&quot; just because we don&#039;t share that kink.  Remittance Girl&#039;s point of view on this seems very myopic, reminiscent of people who insist that &quot;gay sex isn&#039;t really sex&quot;.]]></description>
