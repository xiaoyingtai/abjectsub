					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/top-trust/#comment-573&quot;&gt;Xiao Yingtai&lt;/a&gt;.

Well, that type of conversation is just so much easier for switches to have, because we have experiences from both sides. I&#039;m constantly bewildered by how much I think most tops and most bottoms just don&#039;t understand about each other. There&#039;s a heavy gender overlap there too that just exacerbates the problem... And I don&#039;t think the Leather tradition of having future tops learn by being bottoms necessarily solves that problem, because if the tops don&#039;t really *enjoy* being a bottom--and especially if they never experience subspace for themselves--then they don&#039;t really learn much except vague irritation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As you know, I&#039;m so grateful that you wrote this. I feel very strongly that subs can only be ethical if we face up to the power we have over doms. It&#039;s a blog post I HAVE to write, but first other people have to explain to me all the ways we can damage tops. 

It&#039;s too bad that so few people want to write about that. I guess it&#039;s the ultimate unsexy topic - except with your Midas touch!]]></description>
