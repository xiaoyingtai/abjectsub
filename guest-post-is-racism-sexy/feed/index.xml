But but but I think humiliation can be safe, sane and consensual! Of course &lt;a href=&quot;/the-consent-debate-then-and-now/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;people don&#039;t necessarily agree on what it means&lt;/a&gt;. In my case I mean staying away from sex-shaming language or belittling my reliability or attractiveness, because that wouldn&#039;t be good for my sanity. Someone else might have completely different danger points, but that would also be true for physical limitations. Mental play may be riskier than physical play, but I don&#039;t think it entails taking reckless risks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/guest-post-is-racism-sexy/#comment-989&quot;&gt;Cava Supernova&lt;/a&gt;.

You&#039;ve both already seen &lt;a href=&quot;/emotional-masochism-is-not-therapy/&quot; title=&quot;Emotional Masochism Isn&#039;t Therapy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;my loooong reply&lt;/a&gt;, but I wanted to add two things that didn&#039;t fit into the post:

1) Valery, we actually do agree that the pain is only hot if it&#039;s not traumatic (and that&#039;s a post I&#039;ve wanted to write for a long time). Again and again, I&#039;ve seen things that used to REALLY work for me turn into things that switch me off like a light after I experienced too much of that kind of pain. Both physical and emotional. It&#039;s like Tilari said in &lt;a href=&quot;/emotional-masochism-is-not-therapy/#comments&quot; title=&quot;Emotional Masochism Isn&#039;t Therapy: Comments&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;her comment&lt;/a&gt; on my response - you want to push against the pillars of the sub&#039;s being, but you want to choose the ones that are strong enough that the hurt won&#039;t turn into lasting harm.

2) Cava, when you sent me this piece, I originally thought you were asking, &quot;Why the hell did you think I would be okay with it?&quot; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s exactly that he assumed all kinky people are into all kinks, because he sounds smarter than that. My totally uninformed guess is that this guy assessed you (correctly) as a toppy lady, and that degradation was so intrinsic to his bottoming that he assumed the same about topping. It takes people a lot of experience to realise that there are different flavours of dom/sub/switch. But maybe that&#039;s what you meant and we are just saying the same thing in a different way?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey thanks for the response, that makes an awful lot of sense. It gives me a much better idea of why he might have wanted what he wanted, I still very much doubt I could have been able to go ahead with it though, if I&#039;m honest :o 
I&#039;ll check out those resources - thank you for flagging them up xx]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are so many different types of people and so many different things they want out of their kinky experiences. It&#039;s amazing to keep learning more. 

Definitely food for thought, especially for those who always feel kink should be SSC. T]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kink has many sources. I&#039;ve talked about Jung&#039;s concept of the &quot;shadow self&quot;, but I think there&#039;s also a strand where it&#039;s about facing the external demons in a safe way, too.

I have roleplayed online with subs who have specifically wanted racial abuse as part of the scene and I suspect that it&#039;s that concept of, &quot;this thing that can destroy me in r/l, can&#039;t destroy me here so it is hot.&quot; Some people even find violent sex/roleplay to be therapeutic in terms of reliving in a controlled way some past trauma.

I know I am exploring a lot of my &quot;nightmares&quot; through roleplaying bottom in such things.

See also Pandora Blake&#039;s piece &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandorablake.com/blog/2014/12/strength-humiliation/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Strength through humiliation&lt;/a&gt;, which deals with this from a body-shaming scene in which she was top. I suspect a lot of the dynamic may be similar in various ways.]]></description>
