Yingtai, I&#039;m the same way. The authority/power relationship is &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; in place, and that&#039;s how we want and need it. That does not exclude communication about uncomfortable topics or even complaints, but always still respectful and even deferential]]></description>

Survival is good. But I hope your path brings you all the way to fulfillment in the end. If it doesn&#039;t, there are always other paths. It&#039;s never too late!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/communicating-while-submissive-in-full/#comment-1049&quot;&gt;Tilari&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you for reminding readers of this possibility. Setting aside time to check in with each other in a power-neutral way is often recommended, so I&#039;m guessing it works really well for a lot of people. I must be the odd one out. :) If I feel like Person X has authority over me, then it is always hard to tell them things they might not like to hear, but I literally don&#039;t know how to do it in a power-neutral way. I can prostrate myself or brat, but polite vanilla doesn&#039;t seem to be an option that&#039;s available to me in those relationships. But definitely everyone should do whatever works best for them!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Somewhat the other way around for me. Several things had me convinced I was supposed to be a sub--I like being tied up and I&#039;m a masochist. And it was fun, until it wasn&#039;t, but it never worked. I slowly, with the support of a friend, started exploring domination. I ID&#039;d as a switch for a while, but it was like a wool shirt--irritated even when it fit right. Took me a long time to realize that being a rope slut and a masochist did not make me submissive, that I could be a dominant who just happens to like pain and bondage.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hope it&#039;s not too late to have a conversation about this. 2 months later isn&#039;t too late is it? 

This article is why I don&#039;t consider myself a masochist. 

There are many reasons to want someone to hurt you and I have come up with several reasons to want to be hurt. Therapy is one motivation that could lead someone wanting pain even if they don&#039;t get pleasure from pain. Or someone could get an ego boost for being able to endure something even if they don&#039;t enjoy it in and of itself.

I personally love to feel things intensely so something that I hate might be a desirable experience just because it&#039;s intense. Therefore I might enjoy a painful experience not because I like pain but because I like intensity. I might enjoy a painful experience because it&#039;s surreal. Or because it&#039;s unfamiliar.


Another thing is that everyone enjoys mild pain. That&#039;s what I think anyway. People like spicy food because it&#039;s painful (and therefore stimulating) but at the same time most people (myself included) will enjoy any unpleasant stimulation (due to the fact that it&#039;s still a stimulation) up until the point where it&#039;s overwhelming. I think that&#039;s different from masochism but it can motivate people who aren&#039;t masochistic to seek out something painful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One method that my Captain and I use for communication is setting aside time for a service/relationship/etc check-in. This time can be requested by either myself or my Captain, and the first free time we have goes to it. One difference our check-in has from some of the methods you&#039;ve described is that we intentionally create a power-neutral space so we&#039;re communicating on an equal level, which, come to think of it, may make this completely off-topic from the point of your post. :P 

But I figured I&#039;d chip in my two cents on another communication option in a power exchange relationship. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/emotional-masochism-is-not-therapy/#comment-1013&quot;&gt;sciophilous&lt;/a&gt;.

If both of you don&#039;t feel right about it, then I got something wrong. I think I failed to edit out my initial disbelief that anyone could experience kink as therapy. By the time I finished writing I definitely realised that people are just different, and I tried to say so somewhere, but evidently the piece still has a sceptical tone. Apologies! I think it&#039;s fantastic that you guys can do this.]]></description>
