Too true. Even the top asked me afterwards whether it was too much. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/gasp-shake-thank-you/#comment-348&quot;&gt;gingernic&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you Nic! I just could not believe how emotionally needy I got afterwards, and for so long. Your comment makes me feel so much better about that. And there were all kinds of firsts which I didn&#039;t write about. It&#039;s so good to have permission to have all these pesky feelings.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was almost painful to read, and beyond lovely. I hope you&#039;ve had a chance to thoroughly recover. So much intensity has a habit of changing more than one thinks: a storm that shakes the foundation can leave paintings askew in rooms where nothing is quite damaged.

At any rate. Beautiful. Intense. Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/gasp-shake-thank-you/#comment-346&quot;&gt;ScrewLooseHoney&lt;/a&gt;.

You said it. The sheer terror may be the reason for the thing we&#039;ve emailed about. And he actually stopped early and said we should be cautious because it was the first time. I wonder what he&#039;ll be willing to do to me next time. o.0

Not to worry about the safewords. I said yellow every time, not red. And I asked him not to make me safeword when I wasn&#039;t enjoying it. The sense of responsibility kills me. Most of the safewords were actually because my wretched body can&#039;t hold position very long.

And you&#039;re very welcome!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s intennnnse. I didn&#039;t realize how much pain had been involved. Yeesh! I&#039;m assuming this was a &quot;slow-down&quot; type of safeword, and it was okay for him to bring you back and continue..? I certainly hope so. Anyway, I&#039;m glad you thoroughly enjoyed yourself :)

Oh, and I loved the phrase &quot;canine happiness.&quot; Finally a good way to describe the feeling I get when a partner calls me &quot;good girl.&quot; I feel like an eager-to-please, wide eyed, innocent, slobbering mess..hahah.

And thank you for linking my blog :)]]></description>
