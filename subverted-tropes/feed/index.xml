I&#039;m certainly intrigued! And I remember seeing your comments around the slashosphere, so I&#039;m guessing we have similar ideas of what is fun to read!]]></description>

You are so right, Dr Fell definitely subverts tropes. But while you took a long time to warm up to those characters, I couldn&#039;t do it at all: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Lost-Found-Syd-McGinley-ebook/dp/B005CII9FS/ref=cm_cr-mr-title#rev-dpReviewsMostHelpful-R3RXPBZB74SUC9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Amazon review here&lt;/a&gt;. I had a similarly visceral reaction to her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/What-Worse-Place-Your-Love-ebook/product-reviews/B004GHN4AG/ref=cm_cr_pr_top_helpful?ie=UTF8&#038;showViewpoints=0&#038;sortBy=byRankDescending#R6V5ZB6S156HZ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;venture into science fiction&lt;/a&gt;. She must be a good writer to punch me in the gut like that, but I guess she&#039;s just the kind of writer that people love or hate?]]></description>
