					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/not-censored-thank-you-everyone/#comment-892&quot;&gt;Lace Winter&lt;/a&gt;.

That is pretty scary! I can’t really blame her for acting on her convictions, but I do wish I could sit down and answer her questions for half an hour. Though I have to admit there is something to the theory that witch-hunters are the ones who have the most to hide, so maybe there would be no point. Brr!]]></description>

LOL! Believe it or not, calligraphy makes my neck hurt, not my hands. And blogging is more likely to make me gasp for breath. Isn&#039;t the human body strange? Thank goodness I&#039;m finally getting treatment that works.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/not-censored-thank-you-everyone/#comment-91&quot;&gt;Ferns&lt;/a&gt;.

It pains me so much to decline the very first request! Although it’s true that I only promised to respond to orders. :p And I would happily write obscenities for pay, it’s just that that’s one order I wouldn’t ask permission to display on this blog.

How about a compromise? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pangloss.com/seidel/Shaker/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Shakespearean insults?&lt;/a&gt; My favourite so far is “Methink’st thou art a general offence and every man should beat thee.”

Where’s my red ink?]]></description>

LOL! Thank you. I wonder if your huzzah was what made me think of suggesting Shakespearean insults to Ferns?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Glad it went so smoothly. And yes, that calligraphy is lovely.

I laughed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/gallery/xfac6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this gifset&lt;/a&gt;
 the other day. I&#039;d love to see a whole bunch of sweary abuse hand written with beautiful penmanship :P.
