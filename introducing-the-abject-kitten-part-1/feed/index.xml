It&#039;s funny how our identity crises were about totally different identities, and yet I hear this huge reverberating gong of recognition inside me when you describe yours. I&#039;m so glad you figured it out.]]></description>

I ID&#039;d as a switch for a while, but it was like a wool shirt--irritated even when it fit right. Took me a long time to realize that being a rope slut and a masochist did not make me submissive, that I could be a dominant who just happens to like pain and bondage.]]></description>
