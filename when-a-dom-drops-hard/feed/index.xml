Being an ethical top sounds like my worst nightmare. Would it have helped to be reminded that a lot of us on the other side actually need you to enjoy being Mr. Hyde? When the door closes and I know I&#039;m completely in someone&#039;s power ... it makes me so happy. But only if that someone is revelling in it too - and worthy of all that trust.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;ve had a different path through the same landscape. I can find episodes or experiences that feel like parallels or analogues for the things described in the OP, but they either had different circumstances, or I reacted to them differently, sort of like coming to the same crossroads but from a different branch of the streets, so you need to read the map at a different angle, take a different turn (e.g. turn right instead of go straight on, to end up on the same road)

So I don&#039;t really know which things relate in what ways to the OP, except to say that every element individually feels like something familiar, but the context is all different.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Something similar happened to me - it was an almost existential experience, not to sound overly dramatic. And then, when it was done, I was terrified. It took me some time to come to terms with the fact that there are parts of me that are monstrous, and parts of me that aren&#039;t and that there&#039;s an equilibrium to the whole thing. Interestingly, a similar thing happened a while later when I started practicing Zen mediation more regularly. Barriers go down and perception becomes fluid and it can be really scary to see where you really are, (or aren&#039;t), in all that. 

This post took me right back to that initial shock and reminded me of how horribly hard that process was. I wish I&#039;d had Cowhideman&#039;s thoughts to meditate on at the time - they&#039;re incredibly valuable.]]></description>
