					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/the-submissive-ache/#comment-38&quot;&gt;Dumb Domme&lt;/a&gt;.

LOL! You know us all too well. But that&#039;s what&#039;s going on in our heads, anyway. :p

You are reminding me of Guy Baldwin. Somewhere in his book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Ties-That-Bind-Leather-Commentaries/dp/1881943097/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ties That Bind&lt;/a&gt;, he says that both partners are communicating and driving the scene, it&#039;s just that the top&#039;s communication is mostly verbal and the bottom&#039;s mostly non-verbal. It sounds so simple-minded, but I think it&#039;s one of those unspoken assumptions that Explain So Much when things go wrong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;he managed to describe the very similar feeling you get once you do find your dom. Wanting so badly, and yet it’s unthinkable to demand their attention.&lt;/i&gt;

Unthinkable to &lt;i&gt;demand&lt;/i&gt; attention, perhaps. But it&#039;s not at all unthinkable to &lt;i&gt;elicit&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;encourage&lt;/i&gt; attention. :) From my very limited experience, you submissive types have your sneaky ways of getting what you want. (and thank goodness for that!).]]></description>
