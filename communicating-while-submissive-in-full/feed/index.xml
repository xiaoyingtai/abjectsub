Yingtai, I&#039;m the same way. The authority/power relationship is &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; in place, and that&#039;s how we want and need it. That does not exclude communication about uncomfortable topics or even complaints, but always still respectful and even deferential]]></description>

Thank you for reminding readers of this possibility. Setting aside time to check in with each other in a power-neutral way is often recommended, so I&#039;m guessing it works really well for a lot of people. I must be the odd one out. :) If I feel like Person X has authority over me, then it is always hard to tell them things they might not like to hear, but I literally don&#039;t know how to do it in a power-neutral way. I can prostrate myself or brat, but polite vanilla doesn&#039;t seem to be an option that&#039;s available to me in those relationships. But definitely everyone should do whatever works best for them!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One method that my Captain and I use for communication is setting aside time for a service/relationship/etc check-in. This time can be requested by either myself or my Captain, and the first free time we have goes to it. One difference our check-in has from some of the methods you&#039;ve described is that we intentionally create a power-neutral space so we&#039;re communicating on an equal level, which, come to think of it, may make this completely off-topic from the point of your post. :P 

But I figured I&#039;d chip in my two cents on another communication option in a power exchange relationship. :)]]></description>
