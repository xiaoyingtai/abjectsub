					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/definitions-dammit/#comment-841&quot;&gt;tygerboy&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks! And you make a great point that I&#039;ll have to think about. Maybe going with the flow is letting one part of you have the floor for a good long speech? That&#039;s also very important for self-understanding. I guess when I mentioned internal censorship, I was thinking more of the times when I&#039;ve had misgivings and don&#039;t want to face them and evaluate them. Does that make sense?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is one of those delightful pieces of writing that just make you tingle. it&#039;s short, articulate and just crammed with all sorts of deep thoughts. One thing struck me: Not thinking about certain things isn&#039;t necessarily a form of self-censorship, is it? To me, we sometimes need to stop overthinking some aspects of our lives and just let things play out. Going with the feeling or just letting things happen can be the right answer.]]></description>
