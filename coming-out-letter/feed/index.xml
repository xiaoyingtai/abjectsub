					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/coming-out-letter/#comment-359&quot;&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you! I really should stop being amazed that doms find it interesting to hear what makes a sub tick. After all I am still intensely curious why on earth they would want all that responsibility. Although you seem to be thinking of it more in terms of gender than I do?]]></description>

Apologies, it took me this long to figure out what you meant. I&#039;m a little nervous when I read &quot;prepared to do whatever I require.&quot; You are not throwing out the sub&#039;s right to limits, I hope?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I understand you. Women I was in the process of getting to know might ask what turns me on? After giving this recurring question some real thought, I realize what turns me on is not a specific act, but having the knowledge that the woman in my life is prepared to do whatever I require.  It is her (slavery, submissiveness) and her being prepared to bend to my desires rather than any specific act that is my real turn on.]]></description>
