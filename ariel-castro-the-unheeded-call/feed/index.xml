I know what you mean about scary arousal. But sociopaths do enjoy power, so it is not surprising that as submissives we respond to that. And I agree that being able to talk well about sanity and consensuality is not a good filter for sociopaths. The best advice that I have seen is to observe people&#039;s actions and give them time. Sociopaths are known to be poor at self-monitoring and to get bored easily, so there is every reason to hope that they will give themselves away as nasty/inconsistent people. And there is no harm in acting on the false positives and negatives you get with that test - after all, what matters is whether they behave like a sociopath towards you, not a clinical diagnosis.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really interesting post - I have just read &quot;Confessions of a Sociopath&quot; (M.E Thomas) and Gone Girl (Gillian Flynn) -both of which cover female rather than male sociopathy.  It slightly bothered me because I did find the Thomas book, when she talks about her potential for cruelty, in some way arousing (I am a sub guy) However, both show the mechanisms by which sociopaths &quot;hide in plain sight&quot; - how they mimic the traits of concern, empathy and sociability - in fact their life is one of studied mimicry when it comes to human emotions.  Therefore, this might lead me to be more doubtful when someone goes on to talk of their saneness and consensuality.  Perhaps one clue to a person&#039;s non-sociopathy would be the existence of some sense of secure self: namely durable enthusiasms values and beliefs over time, also an absence of vengefulness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I followed this case as well. From a different point of view, but definitely relevant for a true crime article writer. I could&#039;ve done a piece about this character on my blog. Just to bring awareness and to bring rememberance of what happens around us, without us knowing it.
We could&#039;ve been the ignorant neighbour in the street where this story unfolded. Totally unaware of what happened next door for all those years.]]></description>

Thank you! I agree, my submission bothers me a lot less than my masochism. And I think the fact that it includes a lot of emotional masochism makes it worse. 

But I really look forward to reading what you write about it when the time comes. I know I&#039;ll learn something, because you&#039;ve already made me think with the questions you ask in your posts to date.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, very interesting, honest post. And I&#039;m also referring to your subsequent &quot;Am I Part of the Problem&quot; post, which linked me to this.

I cannot say that I have been in the headspace you&#039;ve described (as I&#039;m more of a submissive than a masochist), however, I have weird inner turmoil over some of my fantasies as well...Maybe I&#039;ll be able to write as thoughtfully about those sometime as you have here. Most of my blog posts so far are just fluff, but some of these issues really do keep me up at night.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] So my complaint is that Zan pays lip service to the consensual reality of BDSM, but when it comes to the &#8220;show&#8221; part of writing, her representation is full of the same old negatives and gender-bias in orientation. While she doesn&#8217;t directly equate BDSM with abuse (only by association), the language of alienness and scariness, of otherness, is what rings in my figurative ears when I read these passages. One case not in Zan&#8217;s list (presumably, too recent to be relevant to her &#8220;long after the initial news stories&#8221;) was Ariel Castro&#8217;s victims: Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight. To sum up why Zan&#8217;s inclusion of BDSM in the way she did is problematic, I can link to a piece by Yingtai @ The University of Abject Submission that does mention that case: [&#8230;]]]></description>

Um, actually, I don&#039;t see it that way. For me, the key difference is concern for the well-being of the sub. Consent is only a proxy measure. (Edit: Okay, not just a proxy, it also has independent value, but it&#039;s not as important.)

I came to this conclusion after reading &lt;a href=&quot;/how-to-do-the-right-kinky-thing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How to Do the Right Kinky Thing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/consent-alone-is-not-enough/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Consent Alone Is Not Enough&lt;/a&gt;, both written by david stein, the originator of the tagline &lt;a href=&quot;http://boybear.us/history.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Safe, Sane and Consensual&lt;/a&gt;.

Logically, concern for the well-being of the dom should also be crucial, but it&#039;s easier to overlook that.]]></description>
